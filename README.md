Hi! I'm Nate Mullaly (They/Them)

Currently, I'm working in a program where I will learn full stack development, starting with Java, followed by SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Previously, I attended three part-time semesters at Cuyahoga Community College for an Associate's degree in Programming and Software Development.
